title: Swapnil's Tutoring
---

Hi, I'm Swapnil Pande. I'm a recent college graduate who has gone through the gauntlet of advanced math, physics, and computer science. I tutor **high school and college students** to help navigate these subjects and build the core intuitions that will help you succeed in your classes and beyond. I do both online and in-person tutoring (in Pittsburgh, PA) in one-on-one sessions.

Some quick stats about me:

* Bachelor's in Engineering from Vanderbilt University: Dual-degree in Mechanical Engineering & Comp Sci/Engineering, GPA 3.98
* Master's in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University: GPA 3.98
* Strengths: Trigonometry, Calculus, Linear Algebra, Physics (Mechanics and Electromagnetism), Computer Science

### <a id="approach"></a>Approach to Tutoring

Advanced topics in mathematics, physics, and computer science are challenging! I believe these classes are a big leap in difficulty as they require students to understand and reason about concepts far removed from our daily experiences. They ask students to build mathematical abstractions, apply those abstractions to solve problems, and then build new abstractions on top of the previous ones in an endless cycle. Furthermore, all of these classes are so intertwined that missing even a single step can make the whole tower come crashing down quickly. I believe this is the source of the questions like "why do we learn calculus, it's not even useful in the real world" and the sentiments of disillusionment with physics and math.

I've been there, and I've been recently. I've found that the teachers from whom I've struggled to learn have forgotten what it's like to see this material for the first time. They fail to take the necessary time to build the foundational intuition for this material, forcing students to memorize answers for the test just to pass the class. On the other hand, my favorite teachers spent most of their time locking in the core intuitions for the class so that the rest of the material is almost self-explanatory.

The latter is at core of my tutoring style. **My goal** with tutoring is to help my students **build the core intuitions** for their classes, rather than simply "showing them the steps" to solve their homework questions. Having just finished my journey through academia, I do still remember my first experiences with these topics and **I am very patient** in helping my students work through the material. I find that I teach (and learn) best with **visual diagrams and spatial analogies** as these can help build strong intuition for abstract ideas. Most importantly, I am **easy to approach** and like to tailor my tutoring style to the needs of my students. I **encourage curiosity** and exploring the concepts in classes beyond the scope of the homework!

My aim isn't just to help you get the grade in your classes, but to arm you with the understanding and confidence to navigate these subjects on your own.  I like to schedule a (free) introductory session with my students to get to know them and their goals better to decide if we're a good fit for each other.
